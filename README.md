The main purpose of this application is to make a copycat of Medium, which is known as an open platform where readers find dynamic thinking, and where expert and undiscovered voices can share their writing on any topic, in other words, a blog.

## How it works

This application is basically a simple blog which requires the user to be subscribed, also, authenticated. If the user doesn't have any active subscription, he will still be able to read part of the content, but, not everything. Currently, the authentication part is done using a library called NextAuth with just Github as login provider.
